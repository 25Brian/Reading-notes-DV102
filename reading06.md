# An introduction to Javascript

## What is Javascript used for?

With Javascript though, websites can become much more dynamic and interactable. With Javascript, hover effects, zooming on images, showing or hiding menus and info, as well as animation.

## Basics of Javascript

Javascript uses variables in their code, allowing people to create variables and to implement them into their code. To create a variable, you must first declare the variable. Declaring a variable is relatively simple. Use `var`, `const`, or `let` to declare your variable. Variable was the default way to declare variables all the way up until 2015. After 2015, const and let were introduced. Const is used for constant variables that shouldn't change and let for ones that may change.
