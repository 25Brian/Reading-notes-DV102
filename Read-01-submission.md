##### What Is Github?

Github is a company that provides a place for people to develop repositories that allows developers to store and edit their code. Furthermore, it allows different developers to look at each others code and to collaborate on more code. 

## How to use Github

How do you write in Github? After creating your own repository and files, you can begin using Github to write and store code. We can use the pound sign or # to create headings. We do this by writing one pound sign at the beginning of a line of code and then writing what we want our header to be following the pound sign. We can make the heading smaller and smaller by adding more pound signs to the beginning of our header with a maximum amound of pound signs being 6. 

## Github Best Practices

There are various mistakes that people implementing Github can make as they write in their repositories. One key error people can make is by not including a space between their text and their syntax. For example, #heading is incorrect, but # heading is. 

Another good idea for using Github is to include a blank line between lines with things in them. Instead of using /. to end off a line, use enter and create a couple of blank lines between lines of text.
