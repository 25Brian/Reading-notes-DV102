# The Coder's Computer

Text editors are the backbone of efficient workers, allowing people to edit, manage, and compile documents that they need into usable and useful forms. In that same vein, Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) allow Coder's to write and manage different codes and coding projects. IDEs compile multiple tools that are useful for coders into one software for them to develop codes in an efficient manner.

## Intro to an IDE

IDE's are different from text editors as they are much less intuitive than traditional Text Editors, instead of clicking through your files, you will need to learn commands fro your IDE or terminal. The most basic command you can enter is pwd, short for print working directory which shows you where you are in the IDE. After finding where you are in the IDE, the next step is to understand what is in the IDE. The command ls (short for list) will give you a list of what exactly is inside the terminal.

## Navigation in your IDE

There are two primary methods of navigation within your IDE, absolute and relative. Absolute can take you from anywhere to anywhere with a specific command. For example, the command ls /home/brianli/projects can take you straight to your courses from anywhere. But to get there using relative navigation, you have to go in order from the largest directory into the smallest folder. The command to get there from the home would be something like : ls and then ls projects to find your courses.
