# What are Javascript Functions?

Functions are one of the most basic and essential bulding blocks of Javascript. A function is used to complete a task or to calculate something. Functions get activated when they are invoked.

## Anatomy of a Function

A function is defined by the function keyword and then the name of the function followed by parantheses. The paranthesis contain parameters for the function and are separated from each other by using commas. Following that the contents that define the function are contained by curly brackets.

`function square(number) {`

`return number * number;`

`}`

As we can see from the example, the function is called square. The number parameter is used for this function. We can see that this function takes our number and multiplies it by itself.
