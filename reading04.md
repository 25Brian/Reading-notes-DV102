# Introduction to HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a widely used markup language that can be found all over the world. HTML can be employed to make websites and essentially delineates what will be on your website.

## HTML Functions

You can use HTML to create elements that in turn change your website so that it fits your needs. There are a large number of elements that you can use to do what you wish. From paragraphs, headers, links, to images.

As we can see, elements consist of several things. First. a tag name that delineates what the element does. Then, if your element requires an attribute, the attribute name. Finally we have our content that contains what we want our element to say or do. Finally, we have our end tag that ends the element.
