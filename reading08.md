# An introduction to Operators in Javascript

Operators are special symbols used to run operations on operands in Javascript. Javascript has three types of operators available. Unary, binary, and one ternary. Operands are things such are variable and values that can be maniupulated by operators.

## Difference between different types of operators

The main difference between the different types of operators are based on how many operands they need to function. For Unary operators, they only need one operand. For binarys they need two.

## What can operators do?

As you may already know, Javascript can do math such as addition, subtraction, division, etc. Using operators we can write out and solve simply equations. Operators can also be used to make simple logical computations. In other words, operators can manipulate different types of operands.
